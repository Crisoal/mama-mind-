# Mam√°Mind: AI-Powered Pregnancy Nutrition Chatbot

## Introduction
Mam√°Mind is a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to support pregnant women with personalized, culturally relevant, and evidence-based nutrition guidance. Built for the **Perplexity Sonar Hackathon**, Mam√°Mind leverages the Perplexity AI Sonar API to generate tailored meal plans, provide nutritional insights, and answer pregnancy-related dietary questions. The project aims to empower expectant mothers by addressing their unique needs based on trimester, dietary preferences, allergies, cultural food traditions, and pregnancy conditions.

**Project Name**: Mam√°Mind  
**Tagline**: Nourishing Your Pregnancy Journey, One Meal at a Time  
**Platform**: WhatsApp Chatbot  
**Target Audience**: Pregnant women seeking accessible, personalized nutrition support

## Features
- **Personalized Onboarding**: Collects user profile details (trimester, dietary preferences, allergies, cultural preferences, pregnancy conditions) via text input to tailor the experience.
- **Weekly Meal Plans**: Generates a 7-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks, aligned with user preferences and nutritional needs for pregnancy.
- **Meal Details**: Allows users to view detailed meal information, including recipes, nutritional benefits, and citations, by selecting a specific day and meal.
- **Nutrition Q&A**: Provides answers to user-initiated dietary questions (e.g., "Is turmeric safe during pregnancy?") using the Sonar API.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Incorporates culturally relevant dishes (e.g., Fijian, Indian) based on user preferences.
- **Twilio Integration**: Ensures messages stay within the 1600-character limit for reliable WhatsApp delivery.


## User Flow
Mam√°Mind operates as a conversational WhatsApp chatbot with a structured flow:

1. **Onboarding & Preferences Setup**:
   - User initiates with "Hi" or "Start".
   - Bot collects:
     - Trimester (e.g., "First")
     - Dietary preferences (e.g., "Vegetarian")
     - Allergies (e.g., "Peanuts")
     - Cultural preferences (e.g., "Indian")
     - Pregnancy conditions (e.g., "Anemia")
     - Usage preferences (e.g., "Weekly meal plans")
   - Input is text-based (e.g., user types "Vegetarian" instead of selecting radio buttons).
   - Example:
     ```
     User: Hi
     Bot: üëã Hi! I‚Äôm Mam√°Mind, your AI-powered pregnancy nutrition coach. Which trimester are you in? (First/Second/Third)
     User: First
     Bot: Thanks! Do you have any dietary preferences? (e.g., Vegetarian, Vegan, No restrictions)
     User: Vegetarian
     ```

2. **Weekly Meal Plan Generator**:
   - User types "Generate meal plan" or receives it automatically (if scheduled).
   - Bot generates a 7-day meal plan using the Sonar API, considering user profile.
   - User selects a day (e.g., "Monday") to view meals, then a meal (e.g., "Breakfast") for details.
   - Example:
     ```
     Bot: Here‚Äôs your Week 8 Meal Plan üçΩÔ∏è (type a day to view details):
     üóìÔ∏è Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday...
     User: Monday
     Bot: üóìÔ∏è Monday
     ü•£ Breakfast: Fonio Pancakes
        Ancient grain pancakes with peanut butter
        ‚ú® Gluten-free with complete protein
     üçé Snack 1: Palmnut Soup Bread...
     üç¥ Select a meal for details: Breakfast | Snack 1 | Lunch | Snack 2 | Dinner
     User: Breakfast
     Bot: ü•£ Breakfast: Fonio Pancakes
     üìù Description: Ancient grain pancakes with peanut butter
     ‚ú® Benefits: Gluten-free with complete protein
     üë©‚Äçüç≥ Recipe: Mix 1 cup fonio flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 cup plant milk. Cook batter on a hot pan, 2 mins per side. Spread 1 tbsp peanut butter.
     üìö Sources: dpuhospital.com, krishnamedicalcentre.org
     üß† Tip: Iron prevents pregnancy anemia - ACOG.
     üì§ Want to share this meal plan? Reply 'Yes' or 'No'.
     ```

3. **Daily Tips & Nudges** (Incomplete):
   - Basic tips are generated for meal plans (e.g., "Iron prevents pregnancy anemia").
   - Planned but not implemented: Scheduled daily tips at 8:00 AM and nudges (e.g., "Don‚Äôt forget your iron-rich smoothie!").
   - Example (current):
     ```
     üß† Tip: Stay hydrated and eat regularly for optimal nutrient absorption.
     ```

4. **User-Initiated Q&A**:
   - Users ask dietary questions (e.g., "Can I eat jackfruit in pregnancy?").
   - Bot responds with concise, evidence-based answers using the Sonar API.
   - Example:
     ```
     User: Is turmeric safe daily?
     Bot: Turmeric is safe in small amounts (e.g., in cooking) during pregnancy but avoid high-dose supplements. Consult your doctor. Source: ACOG.
     ```

5. **Share Meal Plan** (Incomplete):
   - Prompts users to share plans ("Reply 'Yes' or 'No'"), but sharing functionality is not implemented.
   - Planned: Generate a text or PDF for sharing with partners or midwives.

6. **Exit or Restart**:
   - User types "End" to save preferences and exit.
   - "Start over" clears the profile after confirmation.
   - "Update preferences" restarts onboarding.
   - Example:
     ```
     User: End
     Bot: Thank you for using Mam√°Mind! Your preferences have been saved. Type 'Start' anytime to chat again.
     ```

## Technical Implementation
### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Database**: Django ORM (PostgreSQL assumed)
- **AI**: Perplexity Sonar API for meal plan generation and Q&A
- **Messaging**: Twilio WhatsApp API
- **Logging**: Python `logging` module for debugging
- **Deployment**: Not specified (assumed local or cloud-based)

### Key Components
1. **BotLogic (bot_logic.py)**:
   - Core logic for handling user messages and conversation states.
   - Manages onboarding, meal plan generation, day/meal selection, and Q&A.
   - Uses state machine (e.g., `AWAITING_TRIMESTER`, `AWAITING_MEAL_SELECTION`) to track user progress.
   - Integrates with Sonar API for meal plans and tips.
   - Ensures messages stay within Twilio‚Äôs 1600-character limit by truncating descriptions, recipes, and citations.

2. **SonarAPI (sonar.py)**:
   - Interfaces with the Perplexity Sonar API to generate JSON-formatted meal plans.
   - Includes fields: meal name, description, nutritional benefits, recipe, citations.
   - Handles JSON parsing and fallback text processing for robustness.

3. **Models (models.py)**:
   - `User`: Stores phone number, trimester, dietary preferences, allergies, cultural preferences, pregnancy conditions, conversation state, and selected day.
   - `MealPlan`: Saves generated meal plans with week number and JSON data.
   - `DietaryPreference` and `PregnancyCondition`: Store predefined options.

4. **WhatsAppHandler**:
   - Manages Twilio WhatsApp API integration for sending/receiving messages.
   - Ensures reliable message delivery within character limits.

### Project Structure



### Limitations
- **Text Input**: User input is text-based (e.g., "Vegetarian" instead of radio buttons), which may lead to parsing errors for unexpected inputs. Input validation could be improved.
- **Scalability**: Current implementation assumes a single user interaction at a time. High user volumes may require queuing or async processing.
- **Error Handling**: While robust, some edge cases (e.g., malformed Sonar API responses) may need additional handling.
